# Node MySQL Online Retailer

### Overview

This is a node app for a fictitious online retailer that displays it's inventory and allows you to order an item.  The app will first display it's inventory information that includes each item's item number, item description, department and price.  The app then prompts you to enter the item number and quantity of the item you wish to order.  Finally, the app will display the total price for your order.  If your entered item quantity exceeds the item stock, you will be notified and will need to run the app again.
